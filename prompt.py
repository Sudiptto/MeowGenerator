    I am writing an in-depth, multi-part script that will be divided into '{parts}' scenes. Each scene must be vividly descriptive, as the purpose of this script is to serve as a blueprint for creating visual illustrations, later to be used in an image-generating AI. Therefore, I need each scene to be rich in detail, focusing on mood, setting, and character actions. The script is also meant for teens and kids, leaving them in awe. Each scene should be conciseâ€”only one paragraph per scene.

    The format of the script should strictly follow this structure:

    Story Title: {storyTitle}

    Scene 1:
    [Detailed text]

    Scene 2:
    [Detailed text]

    ...

    Scene {parts}:
    [Detailed text]

    The core elements of the story are as follows:

    Emotion: {emotion}
    Character description: {catDescription}
    Setting: {inspirationStory}
    Total Parts: The story should consist of {parts} scenes.

    This is a completely original story, not inspired by any existing works. Please provide the script formatted exactly as requested.
